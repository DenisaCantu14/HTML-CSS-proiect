            <li>There are only 12 times throughout the entire series that Barney shows up without a suit.</li>
            <li>One of the final scenes from How I Met Your Mother in which the mother appears was filmed years ago and only a few people actually know who she is.</li>
            <li>Cobie Smulders is from Vancouver. Her character, Robin Scherbatsky, was originally supposed to be from Toronto, but this was changed to make her also from Vancouver.</li>
            <li>Most of the websites mentioned throughout series are real, such as http://www.stinsonbreastreduction.com/, http://www.goliathbank.com/, and http://www.puzzlesthebar.com/.</li>
            <li>The idea for the "Slap Bet" between Marshall and Barney came from Bays, who would make slap bets with his high school friends.</li>
            <li>The most-viewed episodes were the series finale and the Season 1 episode "The Pineapple Incident."</li>
            <li>Did you guys notice that since they got engaged in almost every episode Ribin been wearing a suit?!</li>
            <li>Jason Segel was Bays and Thomas's first choice for the role of Marshall. They were both huge fans of Freaks and Geeks.</li>
            <li>After the show ended Josh Radnor kept the blue french horn, Neil Patrick Harris got the Playbook and the gang’s MacLaren’s booth, and the three yellow umbrellas now belong to director Pamela Fryman, as well as creators Craig Thomas and Carter Bays.</li>
            <li>In the DVD commentary for the Pilot episode, Josh Radnor reveals that he is allergic to dogs, something the creators didn’t know until Radnor was cast.

    <p>Interesting Facts About Casa de Papel</p>
    <div class="paragraf">
        <ol>
            <li>The song used several times in the series, “Bella Ciao,” is a partisan hymn, adapted from an old Italian country folk song from the latter part of the 19th century.  It is used worldwide as an anti-fascist hymn of freedom and survival in hard times.</li> 
           <li>Denver’s unique laugh was written into the script even before Jaime Lorente was cast in the role. The script simply called for “trashy laughter” and each actor who auditioned interpreted that differently.</li>
           <li>All of the robbers were originally meant to have terminal diseases and that would be the reason why they would unite to make the heist.</li>
           <li>Río (Miguel Herrán) is the youngest of the heist group at 19 years old. Herrán likewise was only 20 years old when filming began.</li> 
          <li>The original title in Spanish is “La Casa de Papel” which translates in English to “The house of paper”, related to the fact that the series takes place in a place where paper money is stored and used to print money. Another title under consideration was “La Casa Di Carta” (House of Cards), but that was abandoned due to the possibility of it being confused with Netflix’s other hit series</li>
           <li>The outside of the building where the heist occurs isn’t the actual Royal Mint of Spain but in fact the Spanish National Research Council in Madrid. There was an attempt to record it at the mint, which was denied by the institution. The interior scenes were recorded in a studio. Also, the Bank of Spain did not allow the production crew to visit the real building to replicate it on set. The interior sets were mostly fictional.</li>
